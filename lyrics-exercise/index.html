            <span>Summer went away</span>
            <span>Still, the yearning stays</span>
            <span>I play it cool with the best of them</span>
            <span>I wait patiently</span>
            <span>He's gonna notice me</span>
            <span>It's okay, we're the best of friends</span>
            <span>Anyway</span>
            <span>I hear it in your voice</span>
            <span>You're smoking with your boys</span>
            <span>I touch my phone as if it's your face</span>
            <span>I didn't choose this town</span>
            <span>I dream of getting out</span>
            <span>There's just one who could make me stay</span>
            <span>All my days</span>

            <span class="label">[pre-chorus]</span>
            <span>From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes</span>
            <span>I waited ages to see you there</span>
            <span>I search the party of better bodies</span>
            <span>Just to learn that you never cared</span>

            <span>I see the great escape</span>
            <span>So long, Daisy May</span>
            <span>I picked the petals, he loves me not</span>
            <span>Something different bloomed</span>
            <span>Writing in my room</span>
            <span>I play my songs in the parking lot</span>
            <span>I'll run away</span>

            <span>From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes</span>
            <span>I called a taxi to take me there</span>
            <span>I search the party of better bodies</span>
            <span>Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare</span>

            <span>From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes</span>
            <span>I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this</span>
            <span>I hosted parties and starved my body</span>
            <span>Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss</span>
            <span>The jokes weren't funny, I took the money</span>
            <span>My friends from home don't know what to say</span>
            <span>I looked around in a blood-soaked gown</span>
            <span>And I saw something they can't take away</span>
            <span>'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned</span>
            <span>Everything you lose is a step you take</span>
            <span>So make the friendship bracelets</span>
            <span>Take the moment and taste it</span>
            <span>You've got no reason to be afraid</span>

            <span>You're on your own, kid</span>
            <span>Yeah, you can face this</span>
            <span>You're on your own, kid</span>
            <span>You always have been</span>

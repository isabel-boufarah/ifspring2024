                    <b class="bold">Introduction</b>My name is Isabel and I'm a junior. I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in Human-Computer Interaction.

                    <b class="bold">Background</b>I have worked with web development before in CSE 330 and an internship. I was prompted to take this class because 
                    I want to learn how to apply design principles
                    to websites.

            <li><div class="flex">
                    <b class="bold">Experience with HTML/CSS/JS</b>I have experience with HTML, CSS and JS. However, I want to improve my ability to layout effective webpages.

            <li><div class="flex">
                    <b class="bold">Hope to learn</b>I hope to learn how to design an effective website and convert that design into an actual webpage.

            <li><div class="flex">
                    <b class="bold">How designing for the screen differs from paper</b>I expect designing for the screen to differ from paper because people interact with a screen differently than paper.
                    People may view and markup a piece of paper, but the screen has tons of different interactions. People
                    must use different input devices, like keyboards or controllers, to interact with different screens.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><div class="flex">
                    <b class="bold">Effective design</b><span>The <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/">Pintrest</a> website uses effective design because the design doesn't overpower
                    the content of the images, but still creates an enjoyable experience for the user.</span>

                    <b class="bold">Effective Communication</b><span>The <a href="https://washubears.com/index.aspx">WashU Athletics</a> website demonstrates effective communication
                    because it uses its design to communicate the purpose of the site. For example, the logo in the center of the menu,
                    the bold red highlights, and the video on the home page communicate that this site is all about athletics, and not just
                    any sports, but serious and successful teams. Honestly, I had trouble deciding if this site had effective design or communication,
                    but they seem closely related since the goal here is to use design to communicate.</span>

                    <b class="bold">Works well</b><span>I think <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive">Google Drive</a> is a website that works well.
                    Google Drive has to maintain a file structure and organization in a way that is easy for users to understand and access.
                    Google Drive accomplishes this with a usable page layout and file system.</span>
